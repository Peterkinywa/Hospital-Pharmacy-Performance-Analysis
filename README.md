# Hospital-Pharmacy-Performance-Analysis

## Task
To use Power BI to clean, model, analyze and visualize the data to support decision-making.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Which diseases are most common across counties?
2. Does a higher number of patient visits always lead to higher pharmacy revenue?
3. Which departments generate the highest pharmacy costs?
4. Are there age groups that consume more medication than others?
5. Are some diagnoses associated with longer hospital stays but lower pharmacy spending?

## Dashboard Requirements
- KPI cards (Total Visits, Total Pharmacy Revenue, Avg Length of Stay)
- Disease trends over time
- Pharmacy cost breakdown by drug category
- County and department comparisons
- Slicers for County, Diagnosis, Date
