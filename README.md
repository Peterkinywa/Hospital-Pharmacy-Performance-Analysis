# Hospital-Pharmacy-Performance-Analysis
The objective of this project on Power BI is for the hospital management to understand patient visits, disease patterns and pharmacy performance.

## Task
To use Power BI to clean, model, analyze and visualize the data to support decision-making.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Which diseases are most common across counties?
2. Does a higher number of patient visits always lead to higher pharmacy revenue?
3. Which departments generate the highest pharmacy costs?
4. Are there age groups that consume more medication than others?
5. Are some diagnoses associated with longer hospital stays but lower pharmacy spending?

## Dashboard Requirements
- KPI cards (Total Visits, Total Pharmacy Revenue, Avg Length of Stay)
- Disease trends over time
- Pharmacy cost breakdown by drug category
- County and department comparisons
- Slicers for County, Diagnosis, Date

## Insights
- The elderly are prone to diseases hence the high drug consumption as compared to the other age categories.
- Malaria drug generated high revenue as compared to the other drugs.
- In the month of March, the hospital and the pharmacy experienced high count of Diagnosis.
- Generally, high visits at the hospital and at the pharmacy led to high revenue for the hospital.
- From the analysis, we can tell that the higher the length of stay at the hospital, the higher the cost and the higher the revenue for the hospital.
